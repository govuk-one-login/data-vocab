  iss:
    range: uri
    description: The `iss` (issuer) claim identifies the principal that issued the JWT. The processing of this claim is generally application specific. [[RFC 7519](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7519), [Section 4.1.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7519#section-4.1.1)]
  sub:
    range: uri
    description: The `sub` (subject) claim identifies the principal that is the subject of the JWT. The claims in a JWT are normally statements about the subject. The subject value MUST either be scoped to be locally unique in the context of the issuer or be globally unique. The processing of this claim is generally application specific. [[RFC 7519](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7519), [Section 4.1.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7519#section-4.1.2)]
  nbf:
    range: integer
    description: The `nbf` (not before) claim identifies the time before which the JWT MUST NOT be accepted for processing. Implementers MAY provide for some small leeway, usually no more than a few minutes, to account for clock skew. [[RFC 7519](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7519), [Section 4.1.5](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7519#section-4.1.5)]
  exp:
    range: integer
    description: The `exp` (expiration time) claim identifies the expiration time on or after which the JWT MUST NOT be accepted for processing. Implementers MAY provide for some small leeway, usually no more than a few minutes, to account for clock skew. [[RFC 7519](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7519), [Section 4.1.4](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7519#section-4.1.4)]
  iat:
    range: integer
    description: The `iat` (issued at) claim identifies the time at which the JWT was issued. This claim can be used to determine the age of the JWT. [[RFC 7519](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7519), [Section 4.1.6](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7519#section-4.1.6)]
  aud:
    range: uri
    description: The `aud` (audience) claim identifies the recipients that the JWT is intended for. Each principal intended to process the JWT MUST identify itself with a value in the audience claim. If the principal processing the claim does not identify itself with a value in the `aud` claim when this claim is present, then the JWT MUST be rejected. [[RFC 7519](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7519), [Section 4.1.3](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7519#section-4.1.3)]
  vc:
    range: VerifiableCredentialClass
  credentialSubject:
    range: PersonClass
  shared_claims:
    range: PersonClass
    description: The shared claims.  This value will detail what shared information the calling service wants to and is permitted to share. 
  response_type:
    range: string
    required: true
    description: The response type.  This value currently needs to be set to the value `code`.
  redirect_uri:
    range: uri
    required: true
    description: The redirect uri.  This value must exactly match one of the redirect uris registered by the Relying Party service and must be URL-encoded.
  state:
    range: string
    required: true
    description: The state.  This value is used to validate the response sent to the redirect URI.  This value will be returned to the client in the authentication response.
  client_id:
    range: StringOrURI
    required: true
    description: The client id.  This value is the client id the Relying Party service was provided with for identification upon registration.  Internal system requests will use an internal client id.
  scope:
    range: string
    required: true
    description: The scope.  A space-separated list of scopes which must include the `openid` value. Other options are `email`, `phone` and `offline_access` (returns a refresh token).  Other custom scopes are available for internal requests.
  nonce:
    range: string
    required: true
    description: The nonce.  A random value provided from the ID token to verify the integrity of the ID token.
  vtr:
    range: string
    multivalued: true
    inlined_as_list: true
    description: The Vector of Trust request. If not specified the default value `Cl.Cm` is used. Further information can be found in [Vectors of Trust RFC](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc8485/)
  prompt:
    range: string
    description: Use the value `login` to force a user to authenticate again even if they have an existing session.  If this is not set a user will authenticate silently if they have an existing session.
  claims:
    range: string
    description: The claims.  This value will detail what additional claims, if any, are required from the /userinfo endpoint after a successful authentication request.  This value should be URL-encoded JSON.

    range: string
    description: The journey id value as assigned by the GOV.UK account sign in process.
