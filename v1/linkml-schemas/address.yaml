    description: The building name is a description applied to a single building or a 
                small group of buildings, such as Highfield House. This also includes those building
                numbers that contain non-numeric characters, such as 44A. Some descriptive names,
                when included with the rest of the address, are sufficient to identify the property
                uniquely and unambiguously, for example, MAGISTRATES COURT. Sometimes the building
                name will be a blend of distinctive and descriptive naming, for example, RAILWAY
                TAVERN (PUBLIC HOUSE) or THE COURT ROYAL (HOTEL).

                only necessary to aid differentiation where there
