                 group of buildings, thus identifying it from its neighbours, for example, 44.
                 Building numbers that contain a range, decimals or non-numeric characters do not
                 appear in this field but will be found in the buildingName or the sub-BuildingName
                 fields.  <b>NOTE - This is a string representation of the building number.</b>

  buildingName:
    close_mappings: adb:buildingName
    description: The building name is a description applied to a single building or a 
                 small group of buildings, such as Highfield House. This also includes those building
                 numbers that contain non-numeric characters, such as 44A. Some descriptive names,
                 when included with the rest of the address, are sufficient to identify the property
                 uniquely and unambiguously, for example, MAGISTRATES COURT. Sometimes the building
                 name will be a blend of distinctive and descriptive naming, for example, RAILWAY
                 TAVERN (PUBLIC HOUSE) or THE COURT ROYAL (HOTEL).

                 STREET, SWAYTHLING, SOUTHAMPTON.
