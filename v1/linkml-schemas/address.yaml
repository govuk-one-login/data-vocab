  organisationName:
    close_mappings: adb:organisationName
    description: The organisation name is the business name given to a delivery point within a building or small group of buildings. E.g. TOURIST INFORMATION CENTRE This field could also include entries for churches, public houses and libraries.
  departmentName:
    close_mappings: adb:departmentName
    description: For some organisations, department name is indicated because mail is received by subdivisions of the main organisation at distinct delivery points. E.g. Organisation Name - ABC COMMUNICATIONS Department Name - MARKETING DEPARTMENT
  subBuildingName:
    close_mappings: adb:subBuildingName
    description: The sub-building name and/or number are identifiers for subdivisions of properties. 
                 E.g. Sub-building Name - FLAT 3 Building Name - POPLAR COURT Thoroughfare - LONDON ROAD NOTE - If the address is styled as 3 POPLAR COURT, all the text will be shown in the Building Name attribute and the Sub-building Name will be empty. The building number will be shown in this field when it contains a range, decimal or non-numeric character (see Building Number).
  buildingNumber:
    close_mappings: adb:buildingNumber
    description: The building number is a number given to a single building or a small
                group of buildings, thus identifying it from its neighbours, for example, 44.
                Building numbers that contain a range, decimals or non-numeric characters do not
                appear in this field but will be found in the buildingName or the sub-BuildingName
                fields.  NOTE - This is a string representation of the building number.
  buildingName:
    close_mappings: adb:buildingName
    description: The building name is a description applied to a single building or a 
                small group of buildings, such as Highfield House. This also includes those building
                numbers that contain non-numeric characters, such as 44A. Some descriptive names,
                when included with the rest of the address, are sufficient to identify the property
                uniquely and unambiguously, for example, MAGISTRATES COURT. Sometimes the building
                name will be a blend of distinctive and descriptive naming, for example, RAILWAY
                TAVERN (PUBLIC HOUSE) or THE COURT ROYAL (HOTEL).
  dependentStreetName:
    close_mappings: adb:dependentThoroughfare
    description: In certain places, for example, town centres, there are named
                thoroughfares/streets within other named thoroughfares/streets, for example, parades of shops on a
                high street where different parades have their own identity. For example, KINGS
                PARADE, HIGH STREET and QUEENS PARADE, HIGH STREET.
  streetName:
    close_mappings: adb:thoroughfare
    description: A thoroughfare/street is fundamentally a road, track or named access route, for example, HIGH STREET.
  doubleDependentAddressLocality:
    close_mappings: adb:doubleDependentLocality
    description: This is used to distinguish between similar thoroughfares/streets or the same
                thoroughfare/street within a dependent locality. For example, Millbrook Industrial Estate
                and Cranford Estate in this situation - BRUNEL WAY, MILLBROOK INDUSTRIAL ESTATE,
                MILLBROOK, SOUTHAMPTON and BRUNEL WAY, CRANFORD ESTATE, MILLBROOK, SOUTHAMPTON.
  dependentAddressLocality:
    close_mappings: adb:dependentLocality
    description: Dependent locality areas define an area within a town. These are
                only necessary to aid differentiation where there
                are thoroughfares/streets of the same name in the same locality. For example, HIGH STREET in
                SHIRLEY and SWAYTHLING in this situation - HIGH STREET, SHIRLEY, SOUTHAMPTON and HIGH
                STREET, SWAYTHLING, SOUTHAMPTON.
  addressLocality:
    close_mappings: adb:postTown
    description: The town or city in which the address resides.
  postalCode:
    exact_mappings: schema:postalCode
    description: A UK postcode is an abbreviated form of address made up of combinations of
                between five and seven alphanumeric characters.  International postal codes have different formats. 
  addressCountry:
    close_mappings: schema:addressCountry
    description: The country. Provided as the two-letter ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code.
